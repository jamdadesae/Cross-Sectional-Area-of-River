# **Cross-Sectional Area of River**

## **Overview**

This website provides a platform for calculating the cross-sectional area of a river based on input data provided in CSV format. The calculated cross-sectional area is then visualized in graph format. The website consists of four main pages:

1. **Home**: Provides an overview of the website's functionality.
2. **About**: Explains the fundamentals of cross-sectional area calculation.
3. **Calculate**: Allows users to upload a CSV file containing river data for cross-sectional area calculation. Additionally, users can choose to view default data and visualize the output in graphs.
4. **Contact Us**: Enables users to contact the company.

## **Usage**
**Calculate Page**

On the Calculate page, users have two options to view the cross-sectional area graphs:

1. **Upload File**: Users can upload a CSV file containing river data. The system will calculate the cross-sectional area based on the provided data and display the output in graphs.

2. **Only Charts Visible**: Users can choose this option to view default data stored in the system. The website will calculate the cross-sectional area using the default data and display the output in graphs.

## **Graph Visualization**

**Visualization with Highcharts**

Highcharts is a JavaScript library for creating interactive and visually appealing charts on web pages. In the context of this website, Highcharts is used to display the calculated cross-sectional area data in graphical format. The graphs generated by Highcharts provide a clear visualization of the cross-sectional area trends of the river.

**Types of Graphs**

1. **Line Chart**: The line chart is commonly used to display the change in cross-sectional area over a continuous range, such as distance along the river. It shows how the cross-sectional area varies with respect to the specified parameters.

2. **Scatter Chart**: The scatter chart can be used to plot individual data points, such as water level versus cross-sectional area. It helps visualize the relationship between different variables and identify any patterns or correlations.

**Interpreting the Graphs**

1. **Trend Analysis**: Users can analyze the trend of the cross-sectional area over the specified parameters, such as distance along the river or water level. They can observe whether the cross-sectional area increases, decreases, or remains relatively constant over the range.

2. **Identifying Patterns**: Users can identify any recurring patterns or irregularities in the cross-sectional area data. This could include sudden changes or fluctuations that may indicate specific features or events along the river.

3. **Correlation Analysis**: Users can examine the relationship between the cross-sectional area and other factors, such as water level or bank depth. By visualizing these relationships, users can gain insights into how different variables affect the cross-sectional area of the river.

**Interactive Features**

Highcharts provides various interactive features that enhance the user experience and facilitate data exploration:

1. **Zooming and Panning**: Users can zoom in on specific sections of the graph to examine them in more detail, or pan across the graph to explore different areas.

2. **Tooltip Information**: Hovering over data points or series on the graph displays tooltips with detailed information, such as the exact value of the cross-sectional area at a specific point.

3. **Exporting Options**: Users can export the graphs in various formats, such as PNG or PDF, for further analysis or sharing with others.

By leveraging these visualization capabilities and interactive features provided by Highcharts, users can effectively analyze the cross-sectional area trends of the river and derive valuable insights from the data.
